        <h3>First Message</h3>
        <p>When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>
        <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.</p>

        <h3>Second Message</h3>

        HERE is Edward Bear, coming downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back of his head, behind
Christopher Robin. It is, as far as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs, but sometimes he
feels that there really is another way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it.
And then he feels that perhaps there isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom,
and ready to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.
When I first heard his name, I said, just as you are going to say, "But I thought he was a boy?"
"So did I," said Christopher Robin.
"Then you can't call him Winnie?"
"I don't."
"But you said--"
"He's Winnie-ther-Pooh. Don't you know what 'ther' means?"
"Ah, yes, now I do," I said quickly; and I hope you do too, because it is all
the explanation you are going to get.
Sometimes Winnie-the-Pooh likes a game of some sort when he comes downstairs, and sometimes he
likes to sit quietly in front of the fire and listen to a story. This evening--
"What about a story?" said Christopher Robin.
"What about a story?" I said.
"Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh one?"
"I suppose I could," I said. "What sort of stories does he like?"
"About himself. Because he's that sort of Bear."
"Oh, I see."
"So could you very sweetly?"

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.</p>
        <p>During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.</p>
        <p>Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy....</p>
    
        <h3>One More</h3>
        I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about <BR>
'Cause you were so excited for me <BR>
To finally drive up to your house <BR>
But today I drove through the suburbs <BR>
Crying 'cause you weren't around <BR>
And you're probably with that blonde girl <BR>
Who always made me doubt <BR>
She's so much older than me <BR>
She's everything I'm insecure about <BR>
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs <BR>
'Cause how could I ever love someone else? <BR>
And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one <BR>
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone<BR>
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <BR>
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street<BR>
